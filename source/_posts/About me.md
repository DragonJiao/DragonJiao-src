I am a senior undergraduate software engineering student at [Tianjin Normal University](http://www.tjnu.edu.cn/), Tianjin, China. I am a key member of the **Cognitive and Affective Computing Lab** at my TJNU, advised by **Prof. Ziping Zhao**. 

My research at TJNU is about applied machine learning and affective computing. If you are interested, checkout my selected projects and publications at here. I also have a few creative open source application projects, like my unique personal website design. Check out them at here.
